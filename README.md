# Description

In linear algebra, Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) is 
an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It is usually 
understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding 
matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to find the rank of 
a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and to calculate the 
inverse of an invertible square matrix. The method is named after Carl 
Friedrich Gauss (1777â€“1855)

## How to compile it ?

```
gcc
```
On linux, a command is called gcc, used to compile C and C++.
```
gcc filename.cpp -o filename
```
To execute:
```
./filename
```

### Optional

You can edit the source code. The file contains the codes and a link 
which can be used to test the code; values are available there and some 
descriptions. You can also fork and translate the file so that you can 
understand what's happening.
